Sentiment analysis is a vital tool for understanding customer experiences, guiding purchasing decisions, and improving product recommendations. Our study focuses on analyzing Amazon reviews to identify factors influencing positive and negative sentiments, leveraging a pre-trained BERT model optimized with Quantized LoRA. Using the Amazon Reviews dataset from Kaggle, we applied state-of-the-art techniques, including automated hyperparameter tuning, to enhance model performance. The optimal configuration achieved a validation loss of 1.1409, highlighting the effectiveness of smaller batch sizes, moderate regularization, and precise learning rate adjustments. This work underscores the importance of advanced modeling and tuning strategies for achieving accurate and scalable sentiment classification.
